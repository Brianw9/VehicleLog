#  Vehicle Logger - WiP

Vehicle Logger is a program used to track maintenance history and upcoming maintenance for all of your vehicles. It's a convenient place to have a record of your fleet vehicles license plates, and scheduled immanence to help predict costs in advance. In the future I would like to expand it to be a mobile application that syncs data between your computer and phone to be more convenient. I also plan to add an option to see a statistical graph to predict monthly maintenance costs throughout the year.


#  What I learned
This project introduced me to JavaFX first and foremost. Along with UI work, it taught me much more about system design, object structures, and Model-View-Controller
